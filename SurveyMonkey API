## 3. Configuration

To use the SurveyMonkey API, you must authenticate using **Bearer Authentication** with your `access_token`. The API key is passed as a Bearer token in the Authorization header for all API requests.

### 1. **Bearer Token Setup**
   - Include your SurveyMonkey API key as a Bearer token in the Authorization header.
   - The Authorization header will look like this:
     - `Authorization: Bearer your_access_token`

### 2. **JSON Configuration Example**

```json
{
  "access_token": "your_surveymonkey_access_token"
}
```

This configuration allows secure access to SurveyMonkey for managing surveys, creating new surveys, and retrieving survey details.
