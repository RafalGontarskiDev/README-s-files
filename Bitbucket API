# Bitbucket API Plugin Documentation

## 1. Overview

This plugin integrates with the **Bitbucket API**, providing a range of methods for interacting with repositories, files, and workspaces. The plugin allows users to list repositories, retrieve file contents, and create commits by uploading files directly to a Bitbucket repository.

     ```plaintext
     GET https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/{{workspaceSlug}}
     ```

### 4. **List Workspaces for User**
   - **What it does**: Fetches a list of workspaces associated with the authenticated user in Bitbucket.
   - **Configuration**:
     - Requires authentication via a Bitbucket API token with `account:read` permissions.
   - **Example Request**:
     ```plaintext
     GET https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/workspaces
     ```
   - **What it returns**: A list of workspaces associated with the authenticated user.

### 5. **Create a Commit by Uploading a File**
   - **What it does**: Creates a new commit in a Bitbucket repository by uploading a file.

     - You need to provide the repository, branch, file path, commit message, and author information.
   - **Example Request**:
     ```json
     {
       "files": "file_path",
       "branch": "main",
       "message": "Commit message",
       "author": "Author Name <email@example.com>"
     }
     ```
   - **What it returns**: A response confirming the successful creation of the commit in the repository.

## 3. Configuration

To use this plugin, you need to authenticate with Bitbucket using an API token (app password). Here's how to set it up:

### **Bitbucket API Token (App Password)**

To generate a personal access token (app password) in Bitbucket:

1. **Log in** to your Bitbucket account.
2. Navigate to **Personal Settings** > **App passwords**.
3. Click **Create app password** and assign the necessary permissions for the methods you want to use:
   - **repository:read** for fetching files or listing repositories.
   - **repository:write** for creating commits.
   - **account:read** for listing workspaces.
4. Generate the token and store it securely, as you won't be able to view it again after creation.

### Example JSON Configuration:

```json
{
  "Repository_Access_Token": "your_bitbucket_access_token"
}
```
