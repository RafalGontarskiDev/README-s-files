The **Vimeo API Plugin** allows integration with Vimeo’s platform, enabling users to retrieve account details, get a list of user videos, and fetch information about a user by their `userId`.

To use the Vimeo API, you must authenticate using **Bearer Authentication** with your `Personal_Access_Token`. The API key is passed as a Bearer token in the Authorization header for all API requests.

### 1. **Bearer Token Setup**
   - Include your Vimeo API token as a Bearer token in the Authorization header.
   - The Authorization header will look like this:
     - `Authorization: Bearer your_Personal_Access_Token`

### 2. **JSON Configuration Example**

```json
{
  "Personal_Access_Token": "your_vimeo_access_token"
}
```

This configuration allows secure access to Vimeo for retrieving user details and videos.
