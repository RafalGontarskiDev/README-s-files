## 3. Configuration

To use the JIRA API, you must authenticate using **Basic Authentication** with your `username` and `API_Token`. The credentials are passed in the Authorization header for all API requests.

### 1. **Basic Authentication Setup**
   - Use your JIRA `username` and `API_Token` for Basic Authentication.
   - The credentials must be base64 encoded and included in the Authorization header.
   - The Authorization header will look like this:
     - `Authorization: Basic base64(username:API_Token)`

### 2. **JSON Configuration Example**

```json
{
  "username": "your_username",
  "API_Token": "your_api_token"
}
```

This configuration ensures secure access to JIRA for creating, commenting on, and updating issues.
