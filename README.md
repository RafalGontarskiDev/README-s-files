### 1. **OAuth Access Token Setup**
   - You can generate an OAuth access token through Trello's developer portal.
   - The token should be included in the headers of all API requests to authenticate and authorize actions on the Trello boards.

### 2. **JSON Configuration Example**

```json
{
  "oauth_access_token": "your_trello_oauth_access_token"
}
```

This configuration ensures secure access to the Trello API and allows the plugin to interact with boards and lists.
