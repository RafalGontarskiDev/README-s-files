# Stripe Webhooks API Plugin Documentation

## 1. Overview

The **Stripe Webhooks API Plugin** allows integration with Stripeâ€™s Webhooks, enabling users to create and retrieve webhook endpoints. Webhooks allow Stripe to notify your application when specific events occur, such as successful payments or refunds. Authentication is managed through **Basic Authentication** using `secret_key`, ensuring secure access to Stripe resources.

## 2. Available Methods

### 1. **Retrieve a Webhook Endpoint**
   - **Endpoint**: `GET https://api.stripe.com/v1/webhook_endpoints/{{endpointId}}`
   - **What it does**: Retrieves details of a specific webhook endpoint by its `endpointId`, including its status, event subscriptions, and URL.
   - **Configuration**:
     - Requires `endpointId`, the unique identifier of the webhook endpoint.
     - Requires **Basic Authentication** using `secret_key`.
   - **Use case**: Use this method to get detailed information about a specific webhook endpoint, such as the URL and the events it listens to.

#### Example Request:
```http
GET https://api.stripe.com/v1/webhook_endpoints/{{endpointId}}
Authorization: Basic {{base64_encoded(secret_key:)}}
```

### 2. **Create a Webhook Endpoint**
   - **Endpoint**: `POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/webhook_endpoints`
   - **What it does**: Creates a new webhook endpoint for receiving Stripe events. You can specify the URL and the list of events the webhook should listen to.
   - **Configuration**:
     - Requires **Basic Authentication** using `secret_key`.
     - The request body must include the URL and the list of events for which the webhook will be triggered.
   - **Use case**: Use this method to set up a new webhook endpoint that will listen for specific Stripe events and notify your application.

#### Example Request Body:
```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/webhook",
  "enabled_events": [
    "payment_intent.succeeded",
    "payment_intent.failed"
  ]
}
```

#### Example Request:
```http
POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/webhook_endpoints
Authorization: Basic {{base64_encoded(secret_key:)}}
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
```

## 3. Configuration

To use the Stripe Webhooks API, you must authenticate using **Basic Authentication** with your `secret_key`. The API key is passed as the username in the Basic Authentication scheme.

### 1. **Basic Authentication Setup**
   - Use your Stripe secret key as the `username` for Basic Authentication.
   - No password is required, but the `:` character is still used in the `base64` encoding.
   - The Authorization header will look like this:
     - `Authorization: Basic base64(secret_key:)`

### 2. **JSON Configuration Example**

```json
{
  "secret_key": "your_stripe_secret_key"
}
```

This configuration allows secure access to Stripe for creating and retrieving webhook endpoints.
