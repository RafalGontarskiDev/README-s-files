# GroqCloud API Plugin Documentation

## 1. Overview

The **GroqCloud API Plugin** enables integration with GroqCloud's platform, allowing users to create chat completions. Authentication is managed through **Bearer Authentication** using `API_key`, ensuring secure access to GroqCloud's resources.

## 2. Available Methods

### 1. **Create Chat Completion**
   - **Endpoint**: `POST https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions`
   - **What it does**: Generates a chat completion response based on a given prompt. This is similar to how OpenAI’s chat completions work, responding to user inputs with AI-generated text.
   - **Configuration**:
     - Requires **Bearer Authentication** using `API_key`.
     - The request body must include the prompt and any other configuration parameters, such as model or temperature.
   - **Use case**: Use this method to integrate chat completions into your applications or services, allowing for AI-generated responses to user queries.

#### Example Request Body:
```json
{
  "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What is the capital of France?"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Example Request:
```http
POST https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions
Authorization: Bearer {{API_key}}
Content-Type: application/json
```

## 3. Configuration

To use the GroqCloud API, you must authenticate using **Bearer Authentication** with your `API_key`. The API key is passed in the Authorization header for all API requests.

### 1. **Bearer Token Setup**
   - Include your GroqCloud API key as a Bearer token in the Authorization header.
   - The Authorization header will look like this:
     - `Authorization: Bearer your_API_key`

### 2. **JSON Configuration Example**

```json
{
  "API_key": "your_groqcloud_api_key"
}
```

This configuration ensures secure access to GroqCloud’s chat completion functionality.
