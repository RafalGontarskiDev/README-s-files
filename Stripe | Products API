## 3. Configuration

To use the Stripe Products API, you must authenticate using **Basic Authentication** with your `secret_key`. The API key is passed as the username in the Basic Authentication scheme.

### 1. **Basic Authentication Setup**
   - Use your Stripe secret key as the `username` for Basic Authentication.
   - No password is required, but the `:` character is still used in the `base64` encoding.
   - The Authorization header will look like this:
     - `Authorization: Basic base64(secret_key:)`

### 2. **JSON Configuration Example**

```json
{
  "secret_key": "your_stripe_secret_key"
}
```

This configuration allows secure access to Stripe for creating, retrieving, updating, and listing products.
