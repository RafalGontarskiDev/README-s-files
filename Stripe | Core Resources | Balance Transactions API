# Stripe Core Resources | Balance Transactions API Plugin Documentation

## 1. Overview

The **Stripe Core Resources | Balance Transactions API Plugin** allows integration with Stripeâ€™s Balance Transactions API, enabling users to retrieve and list balance transactions in their Stripe account. Authentication is managed through **Basic Authentication** using `api_key` (your Stripe API key), ensuring secure access to Stripe resources.

## 2. Available Methods

### 1. **Retrieve a Balance Transaction**
   - **Endpoint**: `GET https://api.stripe.com/v1/balance_transactions/{{transactionId}}`
   - **What it does**: Retrieves detailed information about a specific balance transaction by its `transactionId`.
   - **Configuration**:
     - Requires `transactionId`, the unique identifier of the balance transaction.
     - Requires **Basic Authentication** using `api_key` as the username.
   - **Use case**: Use this method to get details about a particular transaction, such as charges, transfers, fees, or refunds.

```

### 2. **List All Balance Transactions**

## 3. Configuration

To use the Stripe Balance Transactions API, you must authenticate using **Basic Authentication** with your `api_key`. The API key is passed as the username in the Basic Authentication scheme.

### 1. **Basic Authentication Setup**
   - Use your Stripe API key as the `username` for Basic Authentication.
   - No password is required, but the `:` character is still used in the `base64` encoding.
   - The Authorization header will look like this:
     - `Authorization: Basic base64(api_key:)`

### 2. **JSON Configuration Example**

```json
{
  "api_key": "your_stripe_api_key"
}
```

This configuration allows secure access to Stripe's balance transactions for retrieving and listing transaction details.
