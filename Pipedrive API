## 3. Configuration

To use the Pipedrive API, you must authenticate using a **Bearer Personal Access Token**. This token provides access to the user's activities for managing tasks, events, and engagements.

### 1. **Bearer Token Setup**
   - Pipedrive requires an API token, which can be found in the user settings under **Personal Preferences**.
   - The token must be included in the Authorization header for each API request.

### 2. **Required Scopes**
   The API token should have the necessary scopes or permissions to access and manage activities in Pipedrive.

### 3. **JSON Configuration Example**

```json
{
  "personal_API_token": "your_pipedrive_api_token"
}
```

This configuration allows secure access to Pipedrive activities for retrieving, creating, and updating user activities.
