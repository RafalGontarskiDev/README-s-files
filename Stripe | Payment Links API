# Stripe Payment Links API Plugin Documentation

## 1. Overview

The **Stripe Payment Links API Plugin** allows integration with Stripe's Payment Links, enabling users to create payment links for accepting payments without needing to integrate a full checkout page. Authentication is managed through **Basic Authentication** using `secret_key`, ensuring secure access to Stripe resources.

## 2. Available Methods

### 1. **Create a Payment Link**
   - **Endpoint**: `POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_links`
   - **What it does**: Creates a new payment link that can be shared with customers to complete payments using Stripeâ€™s hosted checkout.
   - **Configuration**:
     - Requires **Basic Authentication** using `secret_key`.
     - The request body must include details such as `line_items`, `amount`, `currency`, and any other necessary payment information.
   - **Use case**: Use this method to generate payment links for specific products or services that can be shared with customers via email, social media, or websites.

#### Example Request Body:
```json
{
  "line_items[0][price]": "price_12345",
  "line_items[0][quantity]": 1,
  "after_completion[redirect][url]": "https://your-success-url.com"
}
```

#### Example Request:
```http
POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_links
Authorization: Basic {{base64_encoded(secret_key:)}}
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
```

## 3. Configuration

To use the Stripe Payment Links API, you must authenticate using **Basic Authentication** with your `secret_key`. The API key is passed as the username in the Basic Authentication scheme.

### 1. **Basic Authentication Setup**
   - Use your Stripe secret key as the `username` for Basic Authentication.
   - No password is required, but the `:` character is still used in the `base64` encoding.
   - The Authorization header will look like this:
     - `Authorization: Basic base64(secret_key:)`

### 2. **JSON Configuration Example**

```json
{
  "secret_key": "your_stripe_secret_key"
}
```

This configuration allows secure access to Stripe for creating and managing payment links.
