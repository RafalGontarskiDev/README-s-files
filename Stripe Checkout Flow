# Stripe Checkout Flow Integration

This **Stripe Checkout Flow** integrates the **Stripe Checkout API** and **Stripe Webhook API** to handle payments securely and efficiently. It provides an example template for embedding a checkout button, the process of creating a Stripe Checkout session, and handling the success page. Additionally, webhook integration is included for real-time event handling.

## 1. Overview of Stripe Checkout Flow

The flow consists of three main steps:
1. **Checkout Button and Stripe Checkout Process**: A customer clicks the checkout button, which creates a Stripe Checkout session and redirects them to Stripe's hosted checkout page.
2. **Success Page**: After a successful payment, the customer is redirected to a success page.
3. **Webhook Handling**: Stripe sends events (e.g., payment success) to your webhook endpoint for backend processing.

## 2. Required APIs

### **1. Stripe Checkout API**

- **Create a Checkout Session**: This API is used to create a session for payment and redirect the customer to Stripe's hosted checkout.
    - **Endpoint**: `POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions`
    - **Authentication**: Basic (`username: api_key`)

### **2. Stripe Webhooks API**

- **Create a Webhook Endpoint**: Webhooks are used to listen for Stripe events and handle them accordingly (e.g., payment success).
    - **Endpoint**: `POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/webhook_endpoints`
    - **Authentication**: Basic (`username: secret_key`)

## 3. Create a Checkout Session (Server-Side)
