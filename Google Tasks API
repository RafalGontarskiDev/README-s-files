## 1. Overview

The **Google Tasks API Plugin** enables integration with Google Tasks, allowing developers to manage task lists and tasks programmatically. With this API, you can create, update, retrieve, and manage task lists and individual tasks for improved productivity and organization. Authentication is managed via OAuth2, ensuring secure and delegated access to user tasks.

## 2. Configuration

To use the Google Tasks API, ensure your configuration includes the appropriate OAuth2 credentials with the required scopes for managing tasks:

- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/tasks`: Full access to manage Google Tasks.
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/tasks.readonly`: Read-only access to Google Tasks.
