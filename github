## 3. Configuration

To configure this plugin, you need to provide the following:

- **GitHub API Token**: This plugin requires a personal access token from GitHub with appropriate permissions (`repo` scope) for the necessary methods.
  
  To generate a token:
  - Log in to your GitHub account.
  - Go to **Settings** > **Developer settings** > **Personal access tokens**.
  - Generate a new token with the required scopes.
  
  Store the token securely and provide it in the plugin configuration.

- **Data Format**: The API credentials and other configurations should be provided in JSON format. Here's an example:

  ```json
  {
    "Personal_access_token": "your_personal_access_token"
  }
  ```
