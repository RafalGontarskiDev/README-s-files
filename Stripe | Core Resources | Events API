# Stripe | Core Resources | Events API Plugin Documentation

## 1. Overview

The **Stripe Core Resources | Events API Plugin** allows integration with Stripe's Events API, enabling users to list and retrieve events that happen within their Stripe account, such as successful payments, refunds, and disputes. Authentication is managed through **Basic Authentication** using `secret_key`, ensuring secure access to Stripe resources.

## 2. Available Methods

### 1. **List All Events**
   - **Endpoint**: `GET https://api.stripe.com/v1/events`
   - **What it does**: Retrieves a list of all events that have occurred in your Stripe account. Events include actions such as successful payments, customer updates, or subscription renewals.
   - **Configuration**:
     - Requires **Basic Authentication** using `secret_key`.
     - Optional query parameters can be used to filter and paginate the results (e.g., by event type or date range).
   - **Use case**: Use this method to retrieve all events for monitoring or logging purposes.

#### Example Request:
```http
GET https://api.stripe.com/v1/events
Authorization: Basic {{base64_encoded(secret_key:)}}
```

### 2. **Retrieve an Event**
   - **Endpoint**: `GET https://api.stripe.com/v1/events/{{eventId}}`
   - **What it does**: Retrieves detailed information about a specific event by its `eventId`.
   - **Configuration**:
     - Requires `eventId`, the unique identifier of the event.
     - Requires **Basic Authentication** using `secret_key`.
   - **Use case**: Use this method to get detailed information about a particular event, such as a payment success or a customer update.

#### Example Request:
```http
GET https://api.stripe.com/v1/events/{{eventId}}
Authorization: Basic {{base64_encoded(secret_key:)}}
```

## 3. Configuration

To use the Stripe Events API, you must authenticate using **Basic Authentication** with your `secret_key`. The API key is passed as the username in the Basic Authentication scheme.

### 1. **Basic Authentication Setup**
   - Use your Stripe secret key as the `username` for Basic Authentication.
   - No password is required, but the `:` character is still used in the `base64` encoding.
   - The Authorization header will look like this:
     - `Authorization: Basic base64(secret_key:)`

### 2. **JSON Configuration Example**

```json
{
  "secret_key": "your_stripe_secret_key"
}
```

This configuration allows secure access to Stripe's Events API for retrieving and listing events.
