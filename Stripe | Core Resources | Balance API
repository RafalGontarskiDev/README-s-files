# Stripe Core Resources | Balance API Plugin Documentation

## 1. Overview

The **Stripe Core Resources | Balance API Plugin** enables integration with Stripeâ€™s Balance API, allowing users to retrieve the available and pending balance in their Stripe account. Authentication is managed through **Basic Authentication** using `basic_auth_username_token`, ensuring secure access to Stripe resources.

## 2. Available Methods

### 1. **Retrieve Balance**
   - **Endpoint**: `GET https://api.stripe.com/v1/balance`
   - **What it does**: Retrieves the current balance in your Stripe account, including both available and pending amounts. The balance is provided in the currency associated with the Stripe account.
   - **Configuration**:
     - Requires **Basic Authentication** using the `basic_auth_username_token` (which is your Stripe API key) as the username.
   - **Use case**: Use this method to check the current balance in your Stripe account, including available and pending funds.

#### Example Request:
```http
GET https://api.stripe.com/v1/balance
Authorization: Basic {{base64_encoded(basic_auth_username_token:)}}
```

## 3. Configuration

To use the Stripe Balance API, you must authenticate using **Basic Authentication** with your `basic_auth_username_token` (which is your Stripe API key). The API key is passed as the username in the Basic Authentication scheme.

### 1. **Basic Authentication Setup**
   - Use your Stripe API key as the `username` for Basic Authentication.
   - No password is required, but the `:` character is still used in the `base64` encoding.
   - The Authorization header will look like this:
     - `Authorization: Basic base64(basic_auth_username_token:)`

### 2. **JSON Configuration Example**

```json
{
  "basic_auth_username_token": "your_stripe_api_key"
}
```

This configuration allows secure access to Stripe's balance data for retrieving available and pending funds.
