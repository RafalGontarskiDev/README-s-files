## 3. Configuration

To use the SendGrid API, you must authenticate using **Bearer Authentication** with your `Api_Key`. The API key is passed in the Authorization header for all API requests.

### 1. **Bearer Token Setup**
   - Include your SendGrid API key as a Bearer token in the Authorization header.
   - The Authorization header will look like this:
     - `Authorization: Bearer your_Api_Key`

### 2. **JSON Configuration Example**

```json
{
  "Api_Key": "your_sendgrid_api_key"
}
```

This configuration allows secure access to SendGrid for sending emails, managing bounces, creating event webhooks, and managing contacts.
