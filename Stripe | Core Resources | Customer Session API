# Stripe | Core Resources | Customer Session API Plugin Documentation

## 1. Overview

The **Stripe Core Resources | Customer Session API Plugin** allows integration with Stripeâ€™s Customer Session API, enabling users to create customer sessions for managing customer interactions. Authentication is managed through **Basic Authentication** using `api_key` (your Stripe API key), ensuring secure access to Stripe resources.

## 2. Available Methods

### 1. **Create a Customer Session**
   - **Endpoint**: `POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/customer_sessions`
   - **What it does**: Creates a customer session in Stripe, used to manage and track a customer's activity, typically during payment processing or subscriptions.
   - **Configuration**:
     - Requires **Basic Authentication** using `api_key` as the username.
     - The request body must include relevant customer information, such as `customer`, and session details like `mode` (payment, subscription, etc.).
   - **Use case**: Use this method to create a new customer session for handling payments, subscriptions, or checkout events.

#### Example Request Body:
```json
{
  "customer": "cus_12345",
  "payment_method_types[]": "card",
  "mode": "payment",
  "success_url": "https://your-success-url.com",
  "cancel_url": "https://your-cancel-url.com"
}
```

#### Example Request:
```http
POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/customer_sessions
Authorization: Basic {{base64_encoded(api_key:)}}
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
```

## 3. Configuration

To use the Stripe Customer Session API, you must authenticate using **Basic Authentication** with your `api_key`. The API key is passed as the username in the Basic Authentication scheme.

### 1. **Basic Authentication Setup**
   - Use your Stripe API key as the `username` for Basic Authentication.
   - No password is required, but the `:` character is still used in the `base64` encoding.
   - The Authorization header will look like this:
     - `Authorization: Basic base64(api_key:)`

### 2. **JSON Configuration Example**

```json
{
  "api_key": "your_stripe_api_key"
}
```

This configuration allows secure access to Stripe for creating and managing customer sessions.
