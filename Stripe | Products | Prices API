   - Use your Stripe secret key as the `username` for Basic Authentication.
   - No password is required, but the `:` character is still used in the `base64` encoding.
   - The Authorization header will look like this:
     - `Authorization: Basic base64(secret_key:)`

### 2. **JSON Configuration Example**

```json
{
  "secret_key": "your_stripe_secret_key"
}
```

This configuration allows secure access to Stripe for managing prices, creating new prices, and retrieving or updating existing prices.
