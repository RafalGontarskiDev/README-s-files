# Calendly API Plugin Documentation

## 1. Overview

The **Calendly API Plugin** allows integration with Calendly's scheduling platform, enabling users to create single-use scheduling links, retrieve user data, and create one-off event types. Authentication is managed through a **Bearer Access Token** using `personal_access_token`, ensuring secure access to Calendly resources via the API.

## 2. Available Methods

### 1. **Create Single-Use Scheduling Link**

     - The request body must include the event details, such as the event type and expiration time.

     - The request body must include event details such as the event name, duration, and owner.
   - **Use case**: Use this method to create a special event type for a single-use or one-time occasion.

#### Example Request Body:

  "name": "One-Time Consultation",
  "description": "A 30-minute consultation.",
  "duration": 30,
  "owner": "https://api.calendly.com/users/me"

## 3. Configuration

To use the Calendly API, you must authenticate using an **OAuth2 Bearer Token**. This token provides access to your Calendly account for creating scheduling links, events, and retrieving user information.

### 1. **Bearer Token Setup**
   - Obtain a **Personal Access Token** from the Calendly Developer Portal.
   - The token must be included in the Authorization header as a **Bearer Token** for all API requests.

### 2. **JSON Configuration Example**

```json
{
  "personal_access_token": "your_calendly_personal_access_token"
}
```

This configuration allows secure access to Calendly for managing scheduling links, events, and user data.
