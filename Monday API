# Monday API Plugin Documentation

## 1. Overview

The **Monday API Plugin** allows you to interact with Monday.com to retrieve user data and create notifications. This plugin facilitates seamless integration with Monday’s platform, enabling users to fetch information and automate notifications using a **Bearer API Token** for authentication.

## 2. Available Methods

### 1. **Get User Data**
   - **Endpoint**: `POST https://api.monday.com/v2`
   - **What it does**: Retrieves user data from Monday.com.
   - **Configuration**:
     - Requires a Bearer Token (`Api_token`) for authentication.
     - The request must contain a GraphQL query to retrieve user-specific details such as name, email, and workspace information.
   - **Use case**: Use this method to get information about the authenticated user or other users in your Monday workspace for management or reporting purposes.

#### Example Request Body:
```json
{
  "query": "query { users { id name email } }"
}
```

### 2. **Create a Notification**
   - **Endpoint**: `POST https://api.monday.com/v2`
   - **What it does**: Creates a new notification on Monday.com for a user or board.
   - **Configuration**:
     - Requires a Bearer Token (`Api_token`) for authentication.
     - The request must contain a GraphQL mutation to specify the recipient, message, and context of the notification.
   - **Use case**: Use this method to send notifications to users about project updates, task deadlines, or important events within a Monday.com board or workspace.

#### Example Request Body:

{
  "query": "mutation { create_notification (user_id: 123456, text: \"Your task is due tomorrow!\", target_id: 654321, target_type: Project) { id } }"
}
```

## 3. Configuration

To use this plugin, you will need to authenticate using a **Bearer API Token**. This token must have the appropriate permissions to interact with the Monday.com API based on the actions you intend to perform (fetching user data or creating notifications).

### 1. **Bearer Token Setup**
   - In Monday.com, you can generate an API token by navigating to your profile settings.
   - This API token should be included in the headers of all requests to the Monday.com API.

### 2. **JSON Configuration Example**

```json
{
  "Api_token": "your_monday_api_token"
}
```

This configuration ensures secure access to Monday.com’s API for retrieving user data and sending notifications.
